# NeuVector Example

This example shows how to replace the built-in 'NeuVector' nav item that appears within a cluster when NV is installed.

This is useful for the NV UI extension, where we want the nav item to always be shown and for there not to be 2 items - i.e. the built-in one and the one from the UI extension.

We don't recommend starting from this example - just take the lines from `index.ts` and the `product.ts` files.
